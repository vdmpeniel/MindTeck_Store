*** Modularizing JSP code ***
------------------------------------
- All pages that are dependent on customer info should be in the WEB-INF
folder so they are not accessible from the browser only the landing 
should be outside it.
	They were put into the VIEW folder

- Reusable jsp code such as header and footer were put in JSP-Modules
	jspmodules should be .jspf (fragment)

- To make it work we are using a <jsp-property-group> inside the deployment descriptor (web.xml)
	refer to the code at <!-- INCLUDING HEADER AND FOOTER --> 

------------------------------------
NEXT:
Create all jsps:
	FRONT:
	-Home(generic view) index 
		sign Up/login		
		create customer/open session
		see navigate catalog

	-Customer page with cart/checkout links
		if customer is also an admin show a link to  the administration page

	-cart page/dialog
		show shopping list details:
			list of products and cuantity(product requests)
			price
			taxes
			total price + taxes
		show link to checkout
		show link to continue shopping.

	-checkout page or dialog
		show/get order details:
			shoping cart
			delivery method
			shipping address
			pay method
		create order 
		cancel option

	

	confirmation page or dialog

	BACK:
	administration page:
		Products:
		create product page/dialog
		add product 
		edit product
		
		Customers: 
			delete customer
			add customer
			edit customer

		Orders:
			delete order
			add order
