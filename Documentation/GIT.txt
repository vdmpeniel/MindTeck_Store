Working with remotes:

Before you can start working locally
on a remote branch, you need to fetch it as called out in answers below.

To fetch a branch, you simply need to:

git fetch origin
This will fetch all of the remote branches for you.
You can see the branches available for checkout with:

git branch -v -a
With the remote branches in hand, you now need
to check out the branch you are interested in, giving you a local working copy:

git checkout -b test origin/test
